# Frequently Asked Questions

## What happened to the FAIMS Mobile Platform?

The Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS) Mobile Platform was retired in 2022. The platform was established by archaeologists in 2012 to support the capture and management of digital field data in difficult terrain. The original software ran on  Android only, and was first released in 2014. The last release, v2.6, was in 2017. See 'FAIMS Mobile: Flexible, open-source software for field research' by Ballsun-Stanton et al. (2018) in [SoftwareX](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2017.12.006) for more details.

FAIMS v2.6 was rebuilt from the ground up with the assistance from the Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/)), [doi: 10.47486/PL110](https://dx.doi.org/10.47486/PL110), and our [partners](https://faims.edu.au/partners). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

The working title of the project was 'FAIMS 3.0' and all major releases were named [FAIMS3](https://github.com/FAIMS/FAIMS3).

The software was rebranded Fieldmark™ in 2023.
