## Logging in with Multiple Accounts

You can login to Fieldmark with multiple accounts on a single device and switch
between users. This can be useful when in the field sharing devices between
different members of a team with different credentials.

### Don't Forget

Your login details will be recorded against all new records and any changes made to records while you are logged in. Always check you are correctly signed in. (See [Logging Out](logging-out))

## Troubleshooting

If you cannot see your Notebook on the Workspace:

- talk to your Notebook Administrator and check which account was authorised
- check you have logged in with the account that has been authorised
- check back again a few minutes if the Administrator has only just authorised your account
- sign out and sign in again
