# About Fieldmark™

Fieldmark™ is a software platform for creating custom mobile applications for offline field data collections. It runs on a web browser, Android, and iOS. Notebooks can be customised to collect structured, geospatial, instrument and multimedia data to suit any workflow. Fieldmark™ is proudly open-source.

## How does it work?

Fieldmark™ uses React, Ionic's Capacitor and PouchDB to create custom notebooks that are shared from an online or offline server to registered users. Once a user has activated a notebook they can start collecting data. New records are stored on the local device and synchronised at the first opportunity.

## Who can use it?

Fieldmark™ was built for researchers who want to collect and share high-quality, [FAIR](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/)-compliant data. It can be used by individuals, teams and large organisations. The experience will differ for each group.

## Customising Notebooks

Notebooks can be created in our Notebook Designer on the web. Some advanced features require editing in .json. Once designed, notebooks can edited and adjusted, even after deployment. For more information see [Notebook Creation](intermediate/notebook-creation).   

## Collecting Data

Fieldmark™ collects data of any kind and has inbuilt data formats and metadata to suit the needs of researchers collecting high quality. The App connects directly to your device's camera to take as many photographs as you like. You can also attach any other file to record, eg a digital sketch captured on another app on (or shared with) the same device. For more information see [Field and Record Types](field-record-types).

## Synchronisation

While working online, or within range of an offline server, records will be continuously synchronised. If working offline and without a standalone server, records will be stored on the local device until the next opportunity to synchronise. Users can choose whether or not to synchronise large files and attachments. For more information see [Synchronisation](synchronisation).

## Exporting Data

Data can be exported from Fieldmark™ into .csv, .kml, .json and other formats, as needed. Images, files and folders are renamed in accordance with the record's chosen identifier, saving time when you return from the field. For more information see [Export](export).
