# Getting Started as a Notebook User

Fieldmark is a mobile app for collecting data in the field and can be used in
a wide range of projects.  Each **Notebook** is a collection of forms to
allow you to enter data for your project.  As a notebook user, you will be
using the mobile app to enter data for your project into one or more
notebooks.

## Install the Fieldmark App

The Fieldmark app is available for Android and iOS devices.  You can install the
app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.edu.faims.fieldmark) or the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/fieldmark/id1592632372).

There is also a web-based version of Fieldmark that can be used in a web browser. You
can access this at <https://fieldmark.app/>.  The web based version does not have
all of the capabilities of the mobile app, but can be used for some projects.

## Registration and Login

When you open up the app for the first time
you will see the registration/login screen as shown here.  Here you can login to
the app if you already have an account or use an access code or QR code to register
an account and get access to a notebook.

You need an account on Fieldmark to collect data so that the records that you
create can be associated with you.  The Fieldmark server keeps minimal information
about you - your name and email address - this is only used within the projects
that you collect data for and will never be used for marketing or other purposes.

## Your Invitation

Once the mobile app has been installed, you can get access to a notebook by getting
an invitation in the form of an access code or a QR code.

An access code looks something like _FMRK-ABC123_ and gives you access to a notebook.
The first part (_FMRK_) is a prefix that identifies the server and should match
the prefix shown in your app.  The six character code following that is the code
that you will enter in the app.  Once you enter the code, you will
see the registration screen in the app.

The QR code option makes it easy to get access to a notebook.  Click the
QR Code button and scan the QR code with your device to get to the registration
screen.

If you don't already have an account on the Fieldmark server, you will be able to
register for an account at this point.  You can either register with your email
and password, or you can use a Google account (other authentication options may
be added later).  At this point, registration just gives you access to this one
notebook but you may be given access to others in the future.

If you already have an account on the Fieldmark server, use the button to login
instead of registering a new account.  Once you are logged in you will be given
access to the notebook.

After registering or logging in, you will be shown the main notebook list in
the app and you can activate the notebook you will be working on.
