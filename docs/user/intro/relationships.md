Get to know how relationships work in Fieldmark

## Data Capture

Fieldmark supports two kinds of Relationships between forms:

1. Parent–Child Relationships
2. Linked

## Parent–Child  
:::{index} relationship; parent-child
:::

A parent-child relationship is where the parent form may have one or more records of a child form. An example of a parent-child relationship are specific samples within an area, or elements within a zone. Usually a child form lacks meaning without it's parent providing context.

## Linked
:::{index} relationship; linked
:::

A linked relationship is that of two co-equal forms (of the same or different types) joined by some sort of linking verb. For example, above/below, cutting/cuts-by, linked/linked. Either side of the relationship may be made first, and the relationship can only be instantiated when both records exist.
