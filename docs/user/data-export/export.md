# Exporting your data

There are three types of export from {{FAIMS}}: 

1. Tabular data
2. Spatial data
3. Attachments

Data can be exported from the selected {{Notebook}} on the [{{Dashboard}}](../admin/web.md).

## Tabular data 

The default method of export is tabular data in the form of *comma separated values* (csv). 

Each *Form* or entity will have its own .csv file.

## Spatial data

Additional export formats, eg .kml will be available in future updates.

## Attachments

Images and attached files can be exported in ZIP format separately (ie *Form* by *Form*), or as a bundle.

Images, files and folders are renamed in accordance with the record's chosen identifier, saving time when you return from the field.     

```{note}  
Exported data and files cannot be restored to the App. See for instructions on how to backup your {{Notebook}} in .json format to restore for future use.
```

## Advanced export methods

Data can be exported from {{FAIMS}} [API](api-tokens.md) or [Integrations](integrations.md).
