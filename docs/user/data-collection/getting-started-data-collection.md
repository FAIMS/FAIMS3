# Getting Started as a Data Collector

This quick start guide is for new users working in a small team with an existing **{{FAIMS}} {{Notebook}}**. You will need:

- a mobile device or computer (see [Hardware](hardware.md) for compatibility and recommendations)
- an internet connection, or be connected to the {{FAIMS}} Server (for the initial installation)
- an invitation to join a {{FAIMS}} {{Notebook}}

## 1) Install the {{FAIMS}} App

While you still have an internet connection, download the **{{FAIMS}} app** from the Google Play or the Apple App stores:

- Google Play: {{ANDROID_APP_LINK}}
- Apple App store: {{IOS_APP_LINK}}

Or open the **{{FAIMS}} app** on a web browser on your desktop, or on a mobile device, at one of the following addresses:

- {{FAIMS}} web app: {{APP_URL}}
- the server nominated by your organisation (see your Administrator for details)
- your organisation's server (for Enterprise users, see your Administrator for details)

## 2) Register and Login

When you open up the app for the first time you will see the **login** screen as shown here:  

```{screenshot} getting-started/app-login-mobile.png
:alt: Login Screen
:align: right
```

From here you can login if you already have an account, or refer to your {{Notebook}} invitation and:

- enter an **access code**, or
- scan a **QR code**

to **register** an account and get access to that {{Notebook}}.

````{note} 
If you already have an account on the {{FAIMS}} server, use the button to login instead of registering a new account.  Once you are logged in you will be given access to the {{Notebook}}. For more information, see [Login](login.md).
````

### a) Invitation Codes

An **access code** contains a server prefix and six character code, eg  _FMRK-ABC123_, and gives you access to a specific {{notebook}}. Enter the six character code (eg _ABC123_) on the **Login** screen:

```{screenshot} getting-started/access-code-mobile.png
:alt: Access Code Screen
```

Once you enter the code, you will see the **Registration** screen.

If you have a **QR code**, click the QR Code button and scan the QR code with your device to get to the registration screen.

For more information see [Invitations](invitations.md).

### b) Registering with {{FAIMS}}

If you don't already have an account on the {{FAIMS}} server, you will be able to **register** for an account at this point with either:

- your email and a password, or
- a supported authentication provider (eg your Google account)

At this point, registration just gives you access to this one {{notebook}} but you may be given access to others in the future.

````{note} 
You need an account on {{FAIMS}} to collect data so that the records that you create can be associated with you. The {{FAIMS}} server keeps minimal information about you: your name and email address. These are only used within the projects that you collect data for and will never be used for marketing or other purposes.
````

## 3) Activating your {{Notebook}}

After registering or logging in, you will see the main workspace screen in the app that shows the {{notebooks}} that you have access to:

```{screenshot} getting-started/notebooks-not-active-mobile.png
:alt: Main workspace of the app
:align: right
```

The {{notebook}} that you have just gained access to should appear in the _Not Active_ list.  

A {{notebook}} needs to be _activated_ on your device in order for you to be able to collect data.  

To activate a {{notebook}} on your device:

- click on the _Activate_ button next to the {{notebook}}, and
- wait for it to appear in the _Active_ list:

```{screenshot} getting-started/notebook-list-mobile.png
:alt: Main workspace of the app
:align: left
```

The sync process will now begin, linking your device to the server. You may able to see records from other users, depending on your role with respect to this {{notebook}}.

For more information see [Activating {{Notebook}}s](activating-notebooks.md).

## 4) Using your {{Notebook}}

Once your {{notebook}} is activated, you can begin to create records and these will be automatically saved to the server.  You may also be able to see records from other users, depending on your role with respect to this {{notebook}}.  

As each {{notebook}} is a customised data collection tool, instructions for entering data will differ for each user.

See [Using your {{notebook}}](../todo.md) for more information.
