## Activating your {{Notebook}}

After registering or logging in, you will see the main workspace screen in
the app that shows the {{notebooks}} that you have access to and those that you
are working on:

```

A {{notebook}} needs to be _activated_ on your device in order for you to be able to collect data.  

To activate a {{notebook}} click on the _Activate_ button next to the {{notebook}}.

Activating the {{notebook}} will create the required databases on your device and begin the [synchronisation](./synchronisation.md) process that links your device to the server to save your data.  

```{note} 
Large {{notebook}}s with numerous records and attachments may take some time to synchronise.
```  

Once activated, you can begin to create records in your {{notebook}} and these will be automatically saved to the server.  You may also be able to see records from other users, depending on your role with respect to this {{notebook}}.  

Once activated, your notebook will appear in the _Active_ list in your workspace.
