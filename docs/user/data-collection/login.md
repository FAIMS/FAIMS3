# Logging in to {{FAIMS}}

## Supported Authentication services

**{{FAIMS}}** supports the following authentication systems:

1. Google accounts (Android devices only)
2. AppleID (iOS devices only)
3. Australian Access Federation (AAF)
4. Select institutional accounts (SSO)  

## Login

To sign into **{{FAIMS}}**, choose your authentication provider from the **Login** screen:

:alt: Login Screen
:align: right
```

Check in with your **Team Manager** if you're not sure which authentication service to use.

If your account is recognised, you will be successfully signed in and see your login name and role:

````{Note} 
> Your login details will be recorded against all new records and any changes made to records while you are logged in. Always check you are correctly signed in.

## Logging in for the first time

If you don't already have an account on the {{FAIMS}} server, you will be able to register for an account at this point.  You can either register with your email and password, or a supported authentication service (eg a Google account).

## Logging in with Multiple Accounts

You can login to **{{FAIMS}}** with multiple accounts and switch between users. This can be useful when in the field sharing devices between different members of a team, with different credentials.   

## Troubleshooting

If you cannot see your {{Notebook}} on the Workspace:

- contact your **Team Manager** and check which account was authorised
- check you have logged in with the account that has been authorised
- check back again a few minutes if the **Team Manager** or **Team Administrator** has only just authorised your account
- sign out and sign in again
