# Notebook Invitations

Once the mobile app has been installed, you can get access to a {{notebook}} by getting an invitation in the form of an **access code** or a **QR code**:

Only **Team Managers** and **Team Administrators** can generate invitation codes. See [User roles and permissions](../admin/user-roles-and-permissions-guide.md) for more information.

## Access Codes

An **access code** looks something like _FMRK-ABC123_ and gives you access to the specified {{notebook}}.

The first part (_FMRK_) is a prefix that identifies the server and should match the prefix shown in your app.  

The six character code (_ABC123_) is the one that you will enter in the app.  

Once entered the code, you will see the registration screen.

## QR Coded Invitations

The **QR code** option makes it easy to get access to a {{notebook}}.  QR code invitations can be shared via email, print outs or directly from your **Team Manager**'s device.

To accept the invitation, click the QR Code button and scan the QR code with your device to get to the registration screen.

If you don't already have an account on the {{FAIMS}} server, you will be able to
register for an account at this point.  You can either register with your email
and password, or you can use a Google account.

At this point, registration just gives you access to this one
{{notebook}} but you may be given access to others in the future.

If you already have an account on the {{FAIMS}} server, use the button to login
instead of registering a new account.  Once you are logged in you will be given
access to the {{notebook}}.

After registering or logging in, you will be shown the main {{notebook}} list in
the app and you can activate the {{notebook}} you will be working on.
