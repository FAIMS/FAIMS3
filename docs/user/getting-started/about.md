# About {{FAIMS}}

**{{FAIMS}}** is an open-source tool for creating custom mobile applications to collect research data, while offline. It was launched in 2023 by the [FAIMS Project](https://faims.edu.au/) in partnership with the Australian Research Data Commons ([doi:10.47486/PL110](https://dx.doi.org/10.47486/PL110)), [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/), [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/) and [other collaborators](https://faims.edu.au/partners/).

## How does it work?

**{{FAIMS}}** runs on a web browser, Android and iOS and uses React, Ionic's Capacitor and PouchDB to create **custom {{notebook}}s**. Each **{{notebook}}** is a collection of forms that can be customised to collect structured, geospatial, instrument and multimedia data to suit any workflow. **{{notebook}}s** are shared from an online or offline server to registered users. Once a user has activated a {{notebook}} they can start collecting data. 

## Who can use it?

**{{FAIMS}}** was built for researchers who want to collect and share high-quality, [FAIR](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/)-compliant data. It can be used by **individuals**, **teams** and large **organisations**. The experience will differ for each group.

## Customising Notebooks

**{{Notebook}}s** can be created in our Notebook Designer on the web. Once designed, {{notebook}}s can edited and adjusted (by authorised Users), even after deployment. Learn more about [Notebook Creation](../authoring/quick-start-researchers.md).   

## Collecting Data

**{{FAIMS}}** collects data of any kind and has inbuilt data formats and metadata to suit the needs of researchers. The App connects directly to your device's camera to take photographs and you can also other files to a record, eg a digital sketch captured on another app on (or shared with) the same device. Learn more about [Field and Record Types](../data-collection/field-types-overview.md).

## Synchronisation

While working online, or within range of an offline server, records will be **continuously synchronised**. If working offline and without a standalone server, records will be stored on the local device until the next opportunity to synchronise. Users can choose whether or not to synchronise large files and attachments. Learn more about [Synchronisation](../core/synchronisation.md).

## Exporting Data

Data can be exported from **{{FAIMS}}** into .csv, .kml, .json and other formats. Images, files and folders are renamed in accordance with the record's chosen identifier, saving time when you return from the field. Learn more about [Export](../data-export/export.md).    

## How can I access {{FAIMS}}?

The **{{FAIMS}}** app is available for Android and iOS devices, and on any web browser. You can install the app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store but you will need an Invitation to an existing {{Notebook}} or to sign up for a trial account. For more information see [Getting Started](../data-collection/getting-started-data-collection.md).
