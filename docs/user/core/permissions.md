# Roles and Permissions

{{FAIMS}} uses a role-based permissions system to control access to different
functions and data.  This page outlines the different roles that are
available and what they are allowed to do.

## Resources

The permissions model centres around access to *resources* in the system. These
resources are: *teams*, *user accounts*, *templates* and *{{notebooks}}* and the
*system* as a whole.  A role can be given permission to read, update or create
any of these resources.  So, for example, the system administrator can create
teams and assign a team administrator who can then create users and {{notebooks}}
within that team.

All users in the system are able to:

- list {{notebooks}} that they have access to
- list templates that they have access to
- create and revoke API access tokens

## Global Roles

Global roles apply to the system as a whole and are reserved for
administrative users.

The *General Administrator* role has permission to do anything in the system
and should only be used for emergency interventions. Every deployment has a
default user `admin` with this role configured for local login.  Other users
can be given this role if necessary.

The *Operations Administrator* role is intended for IT staff managing a deployment.
It has permissions to manage teams and users but will not be able to
see any user data.

### Team Roles

Team roles relate to the management of teams, adding users and managing the templates
and {{notebooks}} in the team.

| Permission | Member | Member (Creator) | Manager | Administrator |
|:-----------|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| Read, write and edit records in any {{notebook}} owned by the team | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View any templates owned by the team | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update the details of the team (name and description) | ❌ | ❌ |✅ | ✅ |
| Add or remove members to a team | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create templates and {{notebooks}} within the team | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create and manage member invites to the team | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Act as {{notebook}} manager for any {{notebook}} owned by the team | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add or remove managers to the team | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Act as {{notebook}} administrator for any {{notebook}} owned by the team | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Act as template administrator for any template owned by the team | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

> ⚠️ **Note**: *Team Member (Creator)* can create {{notebooks}} but does NOT automatically get access to existing team {{notebooks}}. This is by design for teaching environments where students create isolated {{notebooks}}.  They would become *{{Notebook}} Administrator* for any {{notebooks}} that they create.

### Template Roles

Template roles give a user permission to work on a particular template.

| Permission | Guest  | Administrator |
|:-----------|:------:|:-------------:|
| View the template | ✅ | ✅ |
| update all details of a template | ❌ | ✅ |
| archive a template so it is no longer available | ❌ | ✅ |

> 💡 **Note**: Template roles are primarily managed through team membership. Team Administrators act as template administrators for team templates.

### {{Notebook}} Roles

{{Notebook}} roles relate to actions on a particular {{notebook}}.

| Permission | Guest  | Contributor | Manager | Administrator |
|:-----------|:------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| Activate the {{notebook}} in the app | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create records in the {{notebook}} | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

| can export data from the {{notebook}} in various formats | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| can create invites for the {{notebook}} and add or remove new guests, contributors and managers | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| add or remove other administrators to the {{notebook}} | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| delete the notebook (operation not currently supported) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
