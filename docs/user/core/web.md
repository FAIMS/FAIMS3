# Using the {{Dashboard}}

The {{dashboard}} is the web based control centre for {{FAIMS}} where you can manage
your teams and {{notebooks}} and where administrators can manage users.  

When you log in to the {{FAIMS}} {{Dashboard}}, you'll see a left sidebar with two sections:

## Content

- **{{Notebooks}}** — View and manage data collection {{notebooks}}
- **Templates** — View and manage reusable notebook templates

## Management

- **Users** — View all system users and their roles (requires appropriate permissions)
- **Teams** — View and manage teams

> 💡 **Tip**: Click on any sidebar item to navigate to that section. The breadcrumb at the top (e.g., "Home > Users") shows your current location.
