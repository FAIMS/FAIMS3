# Marginal data

{{FAIMS}} offers options to annotate data inputs and uncertainty when the options are structured, but the data are fuzzy. These include a **certainty flag** and **annotations** about the selected input.

This is the digital equivalent of writing notes in the margin of a paper form.

These marginal notes and checkboxes are then available alongside the actual data from the selected field, giving users the choice about how to present them when exported from {{FAIMS}}.

## Annotations

An Annotation or marginal note is a text field that is paired with any other *Input* and *Structured Data* field. It is useful when you need to make additional notes about a controlled choice or number field. 

The label for Annotation can be customised to allow for 'General Notes' or something more targeted like 'Recording Conditions'. 

## Certainty Flags

A Certainty Flag is a checkbox that is paried with any other *Input* and *Structured Data* field. This allows the user to 'flag' the value as questionable or uncertain in some way. 

This is the digital equivalent of adding a question mark to a value on a paper form. 

The label for the flag can be customised, so the *Notebook Editor* could include a general flag for 'Not Sure', something more specialised like 'Label obscured' or a call to action such as 'Please Review'. 

## Accessing Annotation and Certainty Flags

If the {{notebook}} field has been configured to allow Annotations or Certainty Flags, you see a small blue icon beside or below the field. 

Tap or click on the icon and the marginal data flyout will appear. 

> [!NOTE]
> All *Input* and *Structured Data* fields can be configured to include an annotation or certainty flag in the [Notebook Editor](.\.\authoring\quick-start-researchers.md).
