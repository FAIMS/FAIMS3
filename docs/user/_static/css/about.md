**Electronic Field Notebooks Pty Ltd (EFN)** was founded in 2020 by current and former researchers from **Macquarie University** while they rebuilt the Field Acquired Information Management Systems (**FAIMS**) mobile platform in [partnership](https://dx.doi.org/10.47486/PL110) with the Australian Research Data Commons (**ARDC**) and 19 institutional and business partners. The platform, now known as **Fieldmark**, was launched in December 2022. You can read more about the project [here](www.faims.edu.au).

In 2023, **EFN** commenced offering hosting services for **Fieldmark**. The **EFN Founders** are  committed to maintaining the open-source platform while meeting the needs of time-poor researchers requiring concierge services to design and deploy their electronic field notebooks and digital recording workflows.
