*An overview of the field types available in the Notebook Editor.*

## Overview

When you design a data collection form in the Notebook Editor, each piece of
information you want to record — a measurement, a description, a photograph,
a location — is captured by a field. {{FAIMS}} provides a range of field types
to match different kinds of data, from short text and numbers to photographs,
GPS coordinates, and hierarchical vocabularies. 

This section is organized into categories that match the tabs in the Notebook Editor, plus guides on shared settings and form design patterns.
