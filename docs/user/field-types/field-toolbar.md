# Field Toolbar

*The icon toolbar in each field's header bar.*

---

## Overview

Every field in the Notebook Editor has a toolbar of icon buttons on
the right side of its header bar (the grey bar you click to expand or
collapse the field). The icons sit to the right of the field's Label,
type badge, and Helper Text preview. These buttons provide quick
actions for managing the field without opening additional menus.

| Trash can | **Delete** | Removes the field from the form. |
| Folder with arrow | **Move to section** | Moves the field to a different section of the form. |
