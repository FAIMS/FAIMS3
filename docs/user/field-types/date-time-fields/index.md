- **[Date time picker](date-time-picker.md)** — Captures date and time
  values. Consider **Date and Time with Now button** instead for timezone
  support.
- **[Date picker](date-picker.md)** — Date-only selection for administrative
  records, permits, and excavation dates.
- **[Month picker](month-picker.md)** — Month-and-year selection for records
  where exact dates are unknown or unnecessary.
- **[Date and Time with Now button](date-time-now.md)** — Timezone-aware
  timestamp capture with an automatic current-time button; the recommended
  date-time field.
