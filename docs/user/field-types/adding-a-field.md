# Adding a Field

*How to open the Add a field dialog and add a new field to your form.*

## The ADD A FIELD Button

Each section in the Notebook Editor has an **ADD A FIELD** button below
the section editing controls and above its **Visible Fields** list.
**Click** this button to open the Add a field dialog.

## The Add a Field Dialog

The dialog has four main areas:

1. **Field name** — a text input at the top, pre-populated with "New
   Field". Type a name here before adding the field; this value
   pre-populates the field's Label.
2. **Tab bar** — a row of category tabs that filter the field type cards
   shown below.
3. **Search field types** — a text input below the tab bar that filters
   cards by name, regardless of which tab is selected.
4. **Field type cards** — a grid of cards, each showing an icon and
   the field type name. **Click** a card to select it, then **click**
   the **ADD FIELD** button in the lower right to add the field to
   your form. **Click** **CANCEL** to close the dialog without adding
   a field.

## Tabs

The tab bar organises field types into nine categories:

| Tab | Field Types |
| --- | ----------- |
| **ALL** | Shows every available field type (default view) |
| **TEXT** | FAIMS Text Field, Multi-line Text Field, Email, Templated String, QR / Barcode Scanner, Address |
| **NUMBERS** | Number Input, Controlled Number, Auto Incrementing Field |
| **DATE & TIME** | Date time picker, Date picker, Month picker, Date and Time with Now button |
| **MEDIA** | Take Photo, Upload a File |
| **LOCATION** | Take GPS Point, Map Field |
| **CHOICE** | Select Field, Select Multiple, Checkbox, Select Field (Hierarchical), Select one option |
| **RELATIONSHIP** | Related Records |
| **DISPLAY** | Rich Text |

> **Note:** Not all tabs may be visible at once. If you see a **›**
> arrow button on the right side of the tab bar, **click** it to scroll
> and reveal additional tabs.

## Tips

- **Name your field before clicking ADD FIELD.** The "Field name" input
  pre-populates the Label and Field ID, saving you a step. You can
  always edit both after adding the field.
- **Use the ALL tab** to browse every field type at a glance, or
  **switch to a category tab** when you know what kind of field you
  need.
