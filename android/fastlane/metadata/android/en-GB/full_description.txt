EFN provides research-focused field data capture and management solutions for individuals, teams, and enterprises. Our app, Fieldmark, is a flexible platform for digital data capture and management in online, network-degraded, or offline fieldwork environments. Fieldmark enables geospatial and multimedia capture combined with structured vocabularies, relational data, and robust data version history. We enable researchers to create high-quality, born-digital datasets with the efficiency needed for high impact research, and support organisations to manage these data assets and meet increasingly complex compliance requirements.
